# Asteroid detect and defense
## Description
Johnny-Five demo files of "Building robots with JS" presentation

This spaceship has to deliver a really important package to the other side of the galaxy, it's a fact.

To avoid asteroids, the spaceship has a proximity sensor. When asteroids gets closer the RGB led alarm turns from green to yellow and from yellow to red.

When asteroids are too closer (from yellow to red), the spaceship turns on the laser weapon (a laser emitter with pan/tilt servos), that means that the laser starts blinking, so the crewman can aim the target with the joystick and press the button to shoot (laser stops blinking turned on).
